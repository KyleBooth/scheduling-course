### Modeling in MiniZinc

In this course, we will be looking at implementations of our various models in MiniZinc. MiniZinc is a high-level modeling software that allows users to model problems using _mixed integer linear programming_ (MILP) or _constraint programming_ (CP). In lecture 9, you saw an introduction to MILP modeling with the _0-1 knapsack problem_ and _single machine scheduling_.

#### Installation

To install MiniZinc, please visit [https://www.minizinc.org/software.html](https://www.minizinc.org/software.html) and download the installer appropriate for your operating system (under "Bundled binary packages"). 

After downloading the installer, run it - this will install the MiniZinc IDE on your machine.

Once the application is installed, copy and paste the models from this repository in the IDE and click "Run" - the solver should start solving the problem and output the solution in the "Output" area. Congratulations on your first successful use of MiniZinc!
