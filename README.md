## Scheduling Course Notebooks
### MSCI 555 - Scheduling Theory & Practice 
#### Instructor/Author: Kyle E. C. Booth, kyle.booth@utoronto.ca
This repository contains various notebooks for some of the content covered in Scheduling: Theory & Practice.
Various implementations of scheduling algorithms and visualizations. Students will not be tested on any of the code; the notebooks can be used by students with Python experience to further explore the concepts. Additionally, various MiniZinc MILP/CP models will be posted in this repository that can be useful starting points for project modeling efforts.

Repository contents:
* Lecture 2: Precedence graphs and makespan (via forward-pass CPM)
* Lecture 5: Complexity (performance of various sorting algorithms)
* Lecture 9: Modeling scheduling problems with MILP (using MiniZinc)
* Lecture 11: Bin Packing for Timetabling (with associated MILP model)
* Lecture 13: Modeling scheduling problems with CP (using MiniZinc)
* Lecture 16: Sports scheduling - single round robin models MILP and CP (using MiniZinc)
