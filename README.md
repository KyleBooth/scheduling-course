### MSCI 555 - Scheduling Theory & Practice 
#### Instructor/Author: Kyle E. C. Booth, kyle.booth@utoronto.ca
This repository contains various notebooks for some of the content covered in Scheduling: Theory & Practice.
Various implementations of scheduling algorithms and visualizations. Students will not be tested on any of the code; it is 
just here to aid my teaching, and for curious students to explore!

Content:
* Lecture 2: Precedence graphs and makespan (via forward-pass CPM)
* Lecture 5: Complexity (performance of various sorting algorithms)
* Lecture 9: Modeling scheduling problems with MILP
